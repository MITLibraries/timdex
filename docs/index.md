# About TIMDEX API

TIMDEX is a free discovery API into collections at MIT Libraries.

## Deprecated REST documentation

Our REST API will be retired by the end of March 2023. However, the [REST documentation](deprecated_rest.html)
does remain available until then. Please don't use it though and instead reach out to us
if you are having issues transitioning to the GraphQL endpoint!
