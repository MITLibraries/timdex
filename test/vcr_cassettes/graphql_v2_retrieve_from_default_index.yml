        analyze labor productivity in coal mining in the United States using indices
        of productivity change associated with the concepts of panel data modeling.
        This approach is valuable when there is extensive heterogeneity in production
        units, as with coal mines. We find substantial returns to scale for coal mining
        in all geographical regions, and find that smooth technical progress is exhibited
        by estimates of the fixed effects for coal mining. We carry out a variety
        of diagnostic analyses of our basic model and primary modeling assumptions,
        using recently proposed methods for addressing ''errors-in-variable'' and
        ''weak instrument bias'' problems, as well a new method for studying errors-in-variables
        in nonlinear contexts."],"timdex_record_id":"dspace:1721.1-44968","title":"Panel
