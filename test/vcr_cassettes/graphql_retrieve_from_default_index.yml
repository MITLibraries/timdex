        in the United States using indices of productivity change associated with
        the concepts of panel data modeling. This approach is valuable when there
        is extensive heterogeneity in production units, as with coal mines. We find
        substantial returns to scale for coal mining in all geographical regions,
        and find that smooth technical progress is exhibited by estimates of the fixed
        effects for coal mining. We carry out a variety of diagnostic analyses of
        our basic model and primary modeling assumptions, using recently proposed
        methods for addressing ''errors-in-variable'' and ''weak instrument bias''
        problems, as well a new method for studying errors-in-variables in nonlinear
        contexts."]}}]}}'
