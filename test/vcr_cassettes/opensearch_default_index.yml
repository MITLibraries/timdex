        analyze labor productivity in coal mining in the United States using indices

        This approach is valuable when there is extensive heterogeneity in production
        units, as with coal mines. We find substantial returns to scale for coal mining
        in all geographical regions, and find that smooth technical progress is exhibited
        by estimates of the fixed effects for coal mining. We carry out a variety
        of diagnostic analyses of our basic model and primary modeling assumptions,
        using recently proposed methods for addressing ''errors-in-variable'' and
        ''weak instrument bias'' problems, as well a new method for studying errors-in-variables

        paper provides an initial analysis of the EU ETS based on the installation-level
        data for verified emissions and allowance allocations in the first trading
        year. Those data, released on May 15, 2006, and subsequent updates revealed
        that CO2 emissions were about 4% lower than the allocated allowances. The
        main objective of the paper is to shed light on the extent to which over-allocation
        and abatement have taken place in 2005. We propose a measure by which over-allocation
        can be judged and provide estimates of abatement based on emissions data and
        indicators of economic activity as well as trends in energy and carbon intensity.

        to 169% and the benefits are many times greater than the costs even without
        the use of MBIs. The paper concludes by commenting on the relative difficulty
