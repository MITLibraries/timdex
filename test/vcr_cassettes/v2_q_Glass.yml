        Note","value":["Charles J. Connick (1875-1945) was an American stained glass
        artist whose work may be found in cities all across the United States. Connick''s
        works in the Arts and Crafts movement and beyond uniquely combined ancient
        and modern techniques and also sparked a revival of medieval European stained
        glass craftsmanship. Connick studied symbols and the interaction between light,
        color and glass, as well as the crucial connection between the stained glass
        window and its surrounding architecture.","Connick founded his own studio
        in 1912 in Boston. The Charles J. Connick Studio performed work for churches,
        synagogues, schools, hospitals, public buildings and private homes in cities
        across the United States and in several other countries. When Connick died
        in 1945, the worker-owned studio continued as Charles J. Connick Associates
        under the supervision of Orin E. Skinner in Boston''s Back Bay until closing
        in 1987.","The Charles J. Connick Stained Glass Foundation was created to
        preserve the Connick tradition of stained glass. At the same time, items from
        the studio were donated to the Boston Public Library''s Fine Arts Department
        to form Charles J. Connick Studio Collection. In 2008, the Foundation donated
        its own collection of stained glass windows, designs, cartoons, slides, documents,
        periodicals, and other items to the MIT Libraries. The collection was processed
        over three years from March 2009 to May 2012."]},{"kind":"Scope and Contents","value":["The

        stained glass, and ephemera.","The primary reference material is the job information.
        In particular, the job files (boxes 7-9) are used most often in research.
