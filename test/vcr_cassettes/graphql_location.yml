        end of the year 2017 is included in this release. The data is made available
        in GeoTIFF 2-BIT raster format with pre-built pyramids using nearest-neighbour
        resampling - with a nominal resolution of approximately 260 metres on the
        ground at the equator. Operators are asked to submit strong (indoor) and variable
        (outdoor) signal strengths: 2G (GSM) Greater than / -92 dBm -92 to -100 dBm,
        3G (UMTS) Greater than -92 dBm / -92 to -100 dBm, 4G (LTE) Greater than -105
        dBm / -105 to -120 dBm. However, the data received from operators often does
        not include signal strength information or does not follow the above guidelines.
        Therefore, whilst the rasters retain the strong and variable distinctions,
        this inconsistency must be understood by the user.The cell values in the MCE
        rasters are as follows: 1 - strong signal strength 2 - variable signal strength.
